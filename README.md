 ## How to use Socket.io- a basic introduction

 This was the first time that I had used Socket.io in one of my projects, so I'm including a really simple tutorial here to get started. It's not meant to be a thorough how to, but if you follow these steps, you should be able to get your front end and back ends speaking to each other via sockets.
